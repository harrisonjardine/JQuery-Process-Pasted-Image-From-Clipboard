## Overview
Simple project to capture, consume and store images from the clipboard using JQuery.

## Implementation
For this project, there is simply one file which needs to be loaded. 

1. On loading the HTML file there will be two boxes displayed.
2. Copy an image (use snipping tool if no image to hand)
3. Paste the image into the larger of the two boxes
4. The images Base64 code will be displayed in the smaller box.

## Uses
Due to the process being complete within JQuery, It is easy to then be manipulated in AJAX. 
This gives the ability to POST the image to any remote or local repository so that it can be easily stored.
In the full working version of this project, the image is directly uploaded to AWS S3. This prject will be added at a later date.
